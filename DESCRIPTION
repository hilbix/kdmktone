This is a helper to play some tunes on the console.

It's commandline is a list of

hz:duration:wait

where hz is the frequency, 0 for 'sound off'<br>
duration is in milliseconds, 100 by default<br>
wait is the wait time, duration by default

You can leave away unused parts, so here is a small Dschingle
<pre>
for a in 1 2 3; do ./kdmktone 1000 1500 2000 0; done
</pre>

Please note that some beepers out there don't like some frequencies,
such that you cannot hear them.  That's not the fault of this tool.
